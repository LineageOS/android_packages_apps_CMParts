      "message": "I don\u0027t agree that this is safe to assume. I guess the _max_ value will be checked in kernel and default can be any value below that. Just thinking of vibrator, which is, if I recall correctly, _not_ set to maximum by default. I think the original value of \"255\" is a valid one except for maybe some devices which should maybe implement that device/kernel side? and if that doesnt work out, introduce a new overlay with the actual max? \"config_buttonBrightnessSettingDefault\" is a _default_ by name, not a _max_\nCould be wrong, ofc",
