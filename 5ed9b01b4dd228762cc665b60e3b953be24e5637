      "message": "The framework code already tolerates null values fine, but I thought it would be nice to have some default string. Configuring the custom string is a separate step which can be skipped. Having a default string shown in that case seemed better (and possibly less confusing) than having nothing at all.\n\nOne alternative would be having a null string at first use, and popping up the EditText after picking the custom string option (but only that first time).\n\nAs for the indention, I guess it\u0027s proof of my eternal struggle with the Eclipse indenting settings.",
